## 🚀 Project Overview
**Puzzle Bar** is a visually engaging web animation project built using **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**.  
The main goal was to explore how smooth, timeline-based animations work in modern front-end development — from element transitions to scroll-triggered effects.

This project was inspired by the GSAP tutorial by [@AW1yfBKRMKc](https://youtu.be/AW1yfBKRMKc?si=dKlBN1VgQbiQ4xYF), which helped me understand how to combine **JavaScript animation logic** with clean **CSS structure** to create an interactive and modern landing page.

## 🧠 What I Learned
Working on this project taught me a lot about **animation fundamentals** and **performance optimization** in front-end development.  
Here’s a breakdown of what I learned:

- 🔹 **GSAP Basics** — Understanding `gsap.to()`, `gsap.from()`, and `gsap.timeline()` for animation sequencing.
- 🔹 **ScrollTrigger** — Triggering animations based on scroll position and creating dynamic user experiences.
- 🔹 **Element Targeting** — How to select and animate multiple elements efficiently.
- 🔹 **Timing & Easing** — Fine-tuning motion curves and animation delays for smoother transitions.
- 🔹 **Project Deployment** — Deploying a static GSAP-based project to **Vercel** directly from **GitHub**.
- 🔹 **Code Structure** — Organizing animation code cleanly to avoid conflicts and ensure readability.

## 🧩 Challenges & How I Solved Them

| Challenge | How I Solved It |
|------------|-----------------|
| GSAP animations not triggering as expected | Carefully reviewed element selectors and timing inside the GSAP timeline. Learned to debug animation order and refresh ScrollTrigger. |
| Page layout breaking during animation | Adjusted CSS positioning (using relative/absolute) and made sure transform origins matched the intended direction of motion. |
| Deploying updates to Vercel | Connected my GitHub repo to Vercel and learned that pushing updates to the main branch automatically redeploys the live site. |
| Animation performance issues on scroll | Optimized DOM elements and avoided redundant triggers by grouping related animations into timelines. |

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- GSAP provides **more control** over animations than CSS transitions.
- Combining **ScrollTrigger** and **timelines** opens endless creative possibilities.
- Smooth animation depends heavily on **DOM structure** and **layer organization**.
- Continuous iteration and debugging are part of every front-end developer’s workflow.
